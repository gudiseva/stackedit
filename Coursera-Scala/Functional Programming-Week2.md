# Higher-Order Functions

- Treat functions as first-class values.
- It means like any other value, a function can be passed as a parameter and returned as a result.

> Functions that take other functions as parameters or that return functions as results are called ***higher order functions***.

## Function Types
- The type `A => B` is the type of a ***function*** that takes an argument of type A and returns a result of type B.
- `Int => Int` is the type of functions that map integers to integers.

## Anonymous Functions

### String Literals
We do not define a String using def.
Instead of
	`def str = "abc"; println(str)`

We can write
	`println("abc")`
