# Curve Analysis
- helps us to know when to be in Bullish or Bearish mode
- Curve Analysis combined with the Odds Enhancers Scoring Methodology dictates the smarter action to be taken (Buy / Sell) and only then we focus on Supply and Demand Zones to time the trade
- Curve Analysis - use of charts where we use Larger Time Frames to identify fresh levels of Supply and Demand
- We assess how close or far our Entries are from these Larger Time Frame Supply and Demand Zones and ...
	  ... the closer we are to these Supply Zones, the more we want to be Sellers
	  ... the closer we are to these Demand Zones, the more we want to be Buyers

### Steps

1. Identify the nearest quality HTF Supply Zone
2. Identify the nearest quality HTF Demand Zone
3. Divide the Range defined by the Proximal Lines of the Supply and Demand Zones into 3 Equal Sections (thirds)
*Use the 3-step zone-ing process*

## Decision Matrix

Draw Retracement Line from Proximal Line of Supply Zone to Proximal Line of Demand Zone

---
---
#### Supply Zone

---
#### High on the Curve (HOC) [Retail Pricing Area]
- (Only Short, when Trend is Down or Sideways)
- Do not Short when the Trend is Up. Also, can't go Long as it's HOC.

---
#### Equilibrium [Fair Pricing Area]
- Go Long when the Trend is Up.
- Short when the Trend is Down.
- As a beginner, avoid taking trades which are in Equilibrium.

---
#### Low on the Curve (LOC) [Wholesale Pricing Area]
- (Only Long, when the Trend is Up or Sideways)
- Do not go Long when the Trend is Down.
- Also, can't Short as it's LOC.

---
#### Demand Zone
