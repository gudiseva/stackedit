# Entry and Exit Strategies

## Types of Entry's

### Type #1 - Proximal Entry
Take entry near the Proximal Line.
Just above in Demand Zone
Just below in Supply Zone

### Type #2 - Zone Entry
Entry Taken inside the Zone

### Type #3 - Confirmation Entry
At the Proximal Line when the price is returning from the Zone.
We will not take inside the zone or when entering the proximal line.

Limit Orders
: Say, CMP is 102. You want to book at 100.

Market Order
: At whatever price the market is offering you.

 
- Stop Loss will go above Distal Line of Supply Zone.
- Stop Loss will go below Distal Line of Demand Zone.

  

## 1 - Proximal Entry
- A Sell limit order is placed before price reaches the proximal line, with a buy stop order just above the Distal line.
- A Buy limit order is placed before the price reaches the proximal line, with a sell stop order just below the Distal line.

Pros and Con:

- We will get entry, but risk is high

  

## 2 - Zone Entry

- A Sell limit or market order is placed when price is anywhere inside the Zupply Zone

  

- A Buy limit or market order is placed when price is anywher inside the Demand Zone

  

Pros and Con:

- We might not get the entry always

  

## 3 - Confirmation Entry

- When price rallies into the Supply Zone, reverses, and crosses below the proximal line, Sell Short

  

- When price drops into the Demand Zone, reverses, and crosses above the proximal line, Buy

  

Pros and Con:

- have to be glued to the computer

### Stop Loss

- For Daily Income Trade and Hourly Income Trade, Stop Loss should be 2% of the Daily ATR.

- For Monthly Income Trade and Weekly Income Trade, Stop Loss will be 10% of DATR.

  

### Daily ATR

Avg. movement of a stock in day.

  

# Exit

1. Make sure, you have clear and planned Target and Stop Loss Exit

2. Target represtns at least 3:1 Reward to Risk Ratio

3. Exit BEFORE the competitive buying and selling begins (just before opposing the Supply and Demand Levels)

4. Managet the trade by only moving the Stop Loss Protective Order in the direction of profitability.

  

# Important Notes:
- Always set your target just below the opposing Supply Zone
- Opposing Supply and Demand Zone are just to book profits.
-   

Targets are set slightly before the opposing Zones

Target represents at least 3:1 Risk to Reward Ratio.
