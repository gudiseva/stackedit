* Entry Type #1 -> Limit Entry or Proximal Entry
* Entry Type #2 -> Entry is at Market Order.  We will wait for the price to close inside the zone.
* Entry Type #3 -> Entry as soon as the price reacts away from the Proximal Line.  Here, we will wait for the price to close inside the zone and execute order when the price reacts.
