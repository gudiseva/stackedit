# Odd Enhancers

- Scoring system that measures the quality of a trade.
- Decide a  minimum score acceptable to enter a trade based on your level of risk aversion.
- We focus on trading only when specific criteria occur in a Price Chart providing a significant advantage or edge.


## Odd Enhancers “Freshness”
> Has price returned to the Zone?

| LTF Zone | Best=3 | Good=1.5 | Poor=0 |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| Supply | Fresh Zone | 1st Touch | 2nd Touch or more than 50% in |
| Demand | Fresh Zone | 1st Touch | 2nd Touch or more than 50% in |

`The “fresher” the Zone, the higher probability that price will turn in that Supply or Demand Zone.`

  

## Odd Enhancers “Strength”
> How did Price leave the Zone?

| LTF Zone | Best=2 | Good=1 | Poor=0 |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Supply | Price left the zone with Gap or 2 consecutive Red Candles | Price has left the Zone with only 1 Red Candle and preceding Green Base Candle | More than 50% of the Base of the Red Leg Candle is submerged within the Zone |
| Demand | Price left the zone with Gap or 2 consecutive Green Candles | Price has left the Zone with only 1 Green Candle and preceding Red Base Candle | More than 50% of the Base of the Green Leg Candle is submerged within the Zone |

`The "stronger" the move away from a Zone, the more out of balance Supply and Demand is in that Zone.`

  

## Odd Enhancers “Time”
> How much Time did Price spend at the Zone?

| LTF Zone | Best=2 | Good=1 | Poor=0 |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Supply | Upto 3 Base Candles in Zone | 4 to 6 Candles | More than 6 Candles |
| Demand | Upto 3 Base Candles in Zone | 4 to 6 Candles | More than 6 Candles |

`The "less time" price spends in a Zone, the more out of balance Supply and Demand is in that Zone.`
