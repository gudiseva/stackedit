# Supply and Demand Zones

## Zones Marking
1. Start with the current price on the chart.
2. Without cutting though candles, look down and left until you find the origin of very strong ("explosive") rally in price.
3. Using the Base / Leg technique, draw Proximal and Distal lines from the origin of the rally and extend them forward.

## Proximal Line Placement
- *Its always concerned with the bases*
- Greater risk -> Proximal line is at the very highest wick in the base
- ***Preferred*** -> Proximal line is at the very highest body in the base
- Lower Odds -> Proximal line is at the very lowest body in the base
- Distal line is at the very lowest wick in the base / formation

## Distal Line Placement

### In case of a Reversal Pattern
- Proximal line is drawn at the very highest candle body in the base
- Distal line is drawn at the very lowest Price of the entire Drop-Base-Rally

### In case of a Continuous Pattern
- Proximal line is drawn at the very highest candle body in the base
- Distal line is drawn at the very lowest Price of the Base-Rally (move out) / Leg-Out
- Ignore the Leg-In Candle

Tested Zone
: pierces the Proximal Line

Violated Zone
: crosses Distal Line
