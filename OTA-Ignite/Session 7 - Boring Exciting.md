## Zones Marking
1. Start with the current price on the chart.
2. Without cutting though candles, look down and left until you find the origin of very strong ("explosive") rally in price.
3. Using the Base / Leg technique, draw Proximal and Distal lines from the origin of the rally and extend them forward.

## Proximal Line Placement
- Its always concerned with the bases
- Proximal line is at the very highest wick in the base
