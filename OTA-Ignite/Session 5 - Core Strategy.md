    Base Candles: These candles imply that Supply and Demand is balanced and the orders are potentially being accumulated. The way to identify the Base Candle is - The size of the body is less than or equal to 50% of the range Leg Candles: The greatest imbalance between Supply and Demand is found at the origin of the leg candles. Candle Body is greater than 50% of the Range Institutions are not chasing price. They are price makers. OTA Core Strategy recommends using Supply and demand zones to identify the behaviour of institutions and trade in their direction as the institutions will buy or sell at a price range where they want to buy or sell. They will not buy or sell after their targetted range How to identify the Suuply and Demand zone?: Your Base candles will be sandwiched between leg candles Following are 4 types of such combinations: DBD (Drop Base Drop)- Supply Zone RBD (Rally Base Drop) - Suuply Zone DBR (Drop base Rally) - Demand ZOne RBR (Rally Base Rally)- Demand Zone
