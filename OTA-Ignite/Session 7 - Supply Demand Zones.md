# Supply and Demand Zones

## Zones Marking - Demand Zone
1. Start with the current price on the chart.
2. Without cutting though candles, look down and left until you find the origin of very strong ("explosive") rally in price.
3. Using the Base / Leg technique, draw Proximal and Distal lines from the origin of the rally and extend them forward.

## Proximal Line Placement - Demand Zone
- ***Its always concerned with the bases***
- Greater risk -> Proximal line is at the very highest wick in the base
- ***Preferred*** -> Proximal line is at the very highest body in the base
- Lower Odds -> Proximal line is at the very lowest body in the base
- Distal line is at the very lowest wick in the base / formation

## Distal Line Placement - Demand Zone

### In case of a Reversal Pattern - *Drop-Base-Rally*
- Proximal line is drawn at the very highest candle body in the base
- Distal line is drawn at the very lowest Price of the entire Drop-Base-Rally

### In case of a Continuous Pattern - *Rally-Base-Rally*
- Proximal line is drawn at the very highest candle body in the base
- Distal line is drawn at the very lowest Price of the Base-Rally (move out) / Leg-Out
- *Ignore the Leg-In Candle*

Tested Zone
: pierces the Proximal Line

Violated Zone
: crosses Distal Line

## Zones Marking - Supply Zone
1. Start with current price on the chart
2. Without cutting through candles, look up and left until you find the origin of a very strong ("explosive") candle
3. TBD

## Proximal Line Placement - Supply Zone
- ***Its always concerned with the bases***
- Greater Risk -> Proximal line at the lowest wick in the base
- ***Preferred*** -> Proximal line at the lowest body in the base
- Lower Odds -> Proximal line at the highest body in the base

## Distal Line Placement - Supply Zone

### In case of a Reversal Pattern - *Rally-Base-Drop*
- Distal line is drawn at the very highest Price of the entire Rally-Base-Drop
- Proximal line is drawn at the very lowest candle body in the base

### In case of a Continuous Pattern - *Drop Base Drop*
- Distal line is drawn at the very highest Price of the Base-Drop (move out) / Leg-Out
- Proximal line is drawn at the very lowest candle body in the base
- *Ignore the Leg-In Candle*

## Base Isolation Technique
Going from Right to Left ...
1. Draw a Vertical Line precisely on top of the Leg Candle that identifies the beginning of the Leg-Out.
2. Draw a second Vertical Line precisely on top of the Leg Candle that identifies the end of the Leg-In.
3. The Base (made of Base Candles) has been isolated between the two Vertical Lines.  Place Proximal and Distal Line accurately and then erase the Vertical Lines.
